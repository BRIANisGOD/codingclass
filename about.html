      <h1>About Brian</h1>
      <h5>2015</h5>
      <p>I am a student at City Arts and Technology Highschool. My interests are are science fiction books, paranormal studies, and robotics. I was always amazed at what science could accomplish like creating robots that help or hurt people.</p>
      <p>In college I hope to learn many things like creating software and understanding theoretical science. In conclusion I want to be the best scientist this dimension has ever seen. I want to learn about quantum physics, I want to be able to create robots, but what I really want is to be remembered.</p>
